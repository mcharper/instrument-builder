# Instrument Builder

## About

This is an experiment with the Web Audio API through the excellent Tone.js API.
The idea is to allow you to play with the Tone.js synths and provide some immediate audio and visual feedback so you can experiment with sounds you like.
Then you can take a patch and use it in another Tone.js app.

It's a react app using redux and it's still under development. 

## Installing

1. Clone the repo.
2. In console, `npm install`.
